          <p>
            <span class="highlight">Hi, I’m Arshpreet Kaur </span>
            — and if I had to sum myself up, I’d say I’m a builder at heart, a
            visionary by nature, and a lifelong learner by choice.
            <br />
            I come from a background that taught me to respect both structure
            and imagination. Growing up, I was the curious child who would sit
            beside my father while he worked, pretending to do the same—turning
            playtime into problem-solving. That instinct to understand how
            things work and how they could work better has shaped my entire
            journey.<br />

            I studied Computer Science because I’ve always seen technology as a
            powerful way to bring ideas to life—not just for innovation’s sake,
            but to make real improvements in the way people live, work, and
            connect. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in data engineering,
            cloud technologies, automation, and visualization—but underneath
            every tool or platform, what drives me is clarity, impact, and
            purpose.<br />

            When it comes to my work ethic, I value responsibility, honesty, and
            precision. I take initiative, ask the right questions, and follow
            through—whether that means learning a new framework overnight or
            taking time to ensure the end user’s experience is seamless. I also
            care deeply about documentation and knowledge sharing. To me, a
            great piece of work isn't just what runs perfectly—it's what others
            can pick up, understand, and build on.<br />

            I believe in designing systems that last, communicating with
            transparency, and balancing vision with humility. I’ve led meetings,
            solved tough bugs, created bots, built pipelines, and learned from
            failure—all while staying anchored in my values: curiosity, empathy,
            and craftsmanship.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <strong>My motto is:</strong> "Create with purpose. Build with
              impact."
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            What makes me different? I think it’s the way I bring both heart and
            logic to everything I do. I don’t cut corners, and I never settle
            for “just okay.” I love working with people who challenge ideas, not
            individuals—who care as much about the why as the how. I'm deeply
            self-motivated, but I also find a lot of joy in
            collaboration—especially when it means creating something that
            didn't exist before.<br />

            In the end, I’m not chasing a title or a checklist. I’m building a
            career where I can keep learning, keep contributing, and keep making
            a difference—one thoughtful project at a time.

                data-description="I wrapped up my final semester and graduated with a Bachelor of Computing Science—but even before walking the stage, I had the chance to give back. I was invited to speak at a career counselling event at TRU, where I shared my co-op journey and lessons learned with an audience of over 60 students. It was an incredible experience—my first time speaking as a guest, and a moment where I realized how far I’d come. This wasn’t just the end of a chapter; it was a powerful reminder of why I started."
