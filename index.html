      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Ever since I was young, technology has captivated me with its endless possibilities and its ability to make a tangible impact on the world. My journey into computer science was inspired by my father, who continues to work in a technology-driven field. Watching him combine creativity, problem-solving, and innovation in his work sparked my curiosity and ambition. I’ve always admired how technology can bring ideas to life, and I knew from an early age that I wanted to be part of that.

        What excites me the most about my field is the opportunity to continuously learn and push boundaries. Each project I undertake feels like a chance to grow, not just as a professional but as a creative problem solver. I’m driven by the idea that real progress doesn’t happen by waiting for the perfect moment—it happens when you take action, put in the effort, and stay dedicated. I thrive on challenges and take pride in knowing that every step forward is the result of my hard work and perseverance.

        One of the qualities that I believe sets me apart is my deep sense of accountability. When I commit to something, I take full ownership and approach it with diligence and attention to detail. Whether it was during my co-op at BCLC, where I worked on data migration and automated solutions, or in my academic pursuits, I’ve learned to embrace responsibility as a driving force behind my success. I’m always looking for ways to improve, constantly striving to be better than I was the day before.

        Looking ahead, my vision is clear. I see myself as a data professional, not just solving problems but creating meaningful solutions that drive positive change. Beyond that, I aspire to mentor the next generation of tech enthusiasts and give back to the community that has helped me grow. And, though public speaking is something I’ve always found challenging, I’m determined to face that fear and one day take the stage at TED Talks to share my journey and ideas.

        Outside of my professional life, I find inspiration in my creative passions, like painting and photography. These hobbies remind me of the beauty in the world and the importance of capturing fleeting moments. Whether it’s a simple landscape or a personal memory, I find joy in making time stand still. This sense of creativity and freedom is something I bring to my work as well, always striving to think beyond the boundaries of what’s expected and find innovative solutions.

        I’m excited for what the future holds, and I am committed to working tirelessly toward my goals, both personal and professional. I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology and innovation, and together, making a positive impact on the world around us.
