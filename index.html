        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>Engineer. Analyst. Artist.</h3>
        <p>
          I'm passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights
          that drive decisions. With hands-on experience in automation and data
          migration at BCLC, I’ve built a solid foundation in problem-solving
          and technical delivery. My background in application development helps
          me understand how data flows through systems — and how to shape it
          effectively. Outside of tech, I find inspiration in photography and
          painting, which sharpen my attention to detail.
